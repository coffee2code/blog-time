Display the time according to your blog via an admin toolbar widget, a sidebar widget, and/or a template tag.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a dynamic, functional clock to the the admin bar (at top of all admin pages) to show the server time for the blog. The clock automatically updates as time passes, as you would expect of a digital clock.

This plugin also supports a static mode which puts a timestamp string at the top of all admin pages instead of the dynamic clock. This static admin time widget is AJAX-ified so that if you click the timestamp, it updates in place (without a page reload) to show the new current server time.

Also provided is a "Blog Time" widget providing the same functionality as the admin widget, but for your sidebars. You may also utilize the plugin's functionality directly within a theme template via use of the template tag `c2c_blog_time()`.

NOTE: For the front-end widget, if the "Use dynamic clock?" configuration option is unchecked, this plugin generates a timestamp and NOT a clock. The time being displayed is the time of the page load, or if clicked, the time when the widget last retrieved the time. It won't actively increment time on the display. By default the widget displays a dynamic clock that does increment time.

This is most useful to see the server/blog time to judge when a time sensitive post, comment, or action would be dated by the blog (i.e. such as monitoring for when to close comments on a contest post, or just accounting for the server being hosted in a different timezone). Or, when used statically as a timestamp and not a clock, it can indicate/preserve when the page was loaded.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip `blog-time.zip` inside the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory for your site (or install via the built-in WordPress plugin installer)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress
1. Optionally use the 'Blog Time' widget or the template tag `c2c_blog_time()` in a theme template file to display the blog's time at the time of the page's rendering.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I customize the format of the time string? =

The widget and template tag allow you specify a time format directly. The default value for the time format, and the one used by the display of the blog time in the static admin widget, can be overridden by adding a filter to 'c2c_blog_time_format' and returning the desired time format. See http://php.net/date for more information regarding the time format.

NOTE: The time string is currently only configurable for the static clock and the widget, not the dynamic admin toolbar clock enabled by default.

= Why is the time not changing in the sidebar widget? =

The widget's "Use dynamic clock?" configuration setting may not be checked (which it is by default).

= The time matches my computer's time; how do I know this thing is working? =

Your machine may well be synced with the server's clock. One test you can perform is to change the blog's time zone (under Settings -> General). The blog's time will then be set to a different hour, which should then be reflected by the widget.

= How do I go back to having the legacy static timestamp as opposed to the dynamic clock? =

See the Filters section for the `c2c_blog_time_active_clock` filter, which includes an example line of code you'll need to add to your theme.

= How can I show the blog's date instead of the time? =

You could do something like this:

`
/* Insert the following code in the active theme's functions.php or, even better,
in a site-specific plugin. */

// Disable dynamic clock since a clock is not being displayed.
add_filter( 'c2c_blog_time_active_clock', '__return_false' );
// Change the datetime format string used by the plugin.
add_filter( 'c2c_blog_time_format', 'my_blog_time_format' );

/**
 * Returns a custom datetime format string for default use
 * by the Blog Time plugin.
 *
 * See http://php.net/date for more information regarding the time format.
 *
 * @param string $format Original format string (ignored)
 * @return string New format string
 */
function my_blog_time_format( $format ) {
	return 'M d, Y';
}
`

== Screenshots ==

1. A screenshot of the blog time being displayed in the admin toolbar.
2. A screenshot of the 'Blog Time' widget.


== Filters ==

The plugin exposes four filters for hooking. Typically, customizations utilizing these hooks would be put into your active theme's functions.php file, or used by another plugin.

= c2c_blog_time (filter) =

The 'c2c_blog_time' hook allows you to use an alternative approach to safely invoke `c2c_blog_time()` in such a way that if the plugin were deactivated or deleted, then your calls to the function won't cause errors in your site.

Arguments:

* same as for `c2c_blog_time()`

Example:

Instead of:

`<?php c2c_blog_time(); ?>`

Do:

`<?php echo apply_filters( 'c2c_blog_time', '' ); ?>`

= c2c_blog_time_format (filter) =

The 'c2c_blog_time_format' hook allows you to customize the default format for the blog time. By default this is 'g:i A' (though this may be different if modified by localization). *NOTE: This currently only applies to the static clock and not the dynamic clock.*

Arguments:

* $format (string): The default format for the blog time.

Example:

`
/**
 * Change the default blog time string
 *
 * @param string $format The default time format.
 * @return string
 */
function change_blog_time_format( $format ) {
	return 'b, g:i A';
}
add_filter( 'c2c_blog_time_format', 'change_blog_time_format' );
`

= c2c_blog_time_toolbar_widget_for_user (filter) =

The 'c2c_blog_time_toolbar_widget_for_user' hook allows you to control if the admin toolbar clock widget should be shown, on a per-user basis. By default the admin toolbar clock is shown to everyone who can see the admin toolbar.

Arguments:

* $shown (boolean): Whether the admin toolbar clock widget should be shown. Default of true.

Example:

`
/**
 * Only show the admin toolbar clock for the 'boss' user.
 *
 * @param $show bool Status of whether the admin toolbar clock should be shown.
 * @return bool
 */
function restrict_blog_time_widget_appearance( $show ) {
	return 'boss' == get_current_user()->user_login;
}
add_filter( 'c2c_blog_time_toolbar_widget_for_user', 'restrict_blog_time_widget_appearance' );
`

= c2c_blog_time_active_clock (filter) =

The 'c2c_blog_time_active_clock' hook returns the boolean value indicating if the Javascript-powered dynamic clock introduced in v2.0 should be enabled or if instead the v1.x era behavior of a static timestamp that can be clicked to update the timestamp via AJAX should be enabled. By default the dynamic clock is enabled.

Arguments:

* $allow (boolean): Boolean indicating if the admin widget should be a dynamic clock. Default is true.

Example:

`
// Disable the dynamic clock and use the static timestamp (whcih can be clicked to update the time via AJAX) instead.
add_filter( 'c2c_blog_time_active_clock', '__return_false' );
`
